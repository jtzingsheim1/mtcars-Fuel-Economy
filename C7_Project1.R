# Coursera Data Science Specialization Course 7 Project 1 Script


# The purpose of this script is to complete the basic requirements behind the
# project 1 peer-graded assignment which is part of the Regression Models course
# from Johns Hopkins University within the Data Science Specialization on
# Coursera.
#
# The instructions say to perform exploratory data analysis and use regression
# models with the mtcars data set to answer these questions:
# 1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for fuel economy
# 2. Quantify the impact of transmission type on fuel economy
#
# The input for this document is the mtcars data set which comes as part of the
# datasets package in base R. There is no specific output for this script, the
# script will just be used as a starting point for creating a markdown file
# which will later be used to create a final report.
