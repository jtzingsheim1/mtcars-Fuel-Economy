# mtcars Fuel Economy Project README

## Overview

This repo contains my work from the course project from the
[Regression Models course][1] from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. The script
and markdown files were created in RStudio.

## Brief Description

The original instructions for this assignment are shown below, and addtional
detail can be found in the [instructor's repo][3]. There are three main files in
this repo: a script, an Rmd file, and the pdf report. The project began with the
script, where the core analysis was performed. Once complete the script was
re-written as an Rmd file, but it was also reduced significantly to fall within
the page limitation for the report. The R markdown file was knit into a pdf
report which was the deliverable for the assignment.

># Regression models final project
>
>## Context
>You work for Motor Trend magazine. Looking at a data set of a collection of
cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of
variables and MPG (outcome). They are particularly interested in the questions
>
>- "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
>- "How different is the MPG between automatic manual transmission?"
>
>## Question
>Take the `mtcars` data set and write up an analysis to answer their question
using regression models and exploratory data analyses.
>
>## Form of report
>Your report must be
>* Written as a pdf printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
>  * Do not use any packages that are not in R-base or the library datasets. 
>* Brief. roughly the equivalent of 2 pages long or less. 
>* Include a first paragraph executive summary.
>  
>### Peer grading
>Your report will be graded on the following equally weighted criteria:
>
>1. Did you interpret your coefficients correctly?
>2. Did you do some exploratory data analyses?
>3. Did you fit multiple models and detail your strategy for model selection?
>4. Did you answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is
(are) not answerable?
>5. Did you do a residual plot and some diagnostics?
>6. Did you quantify the uncertainty in your conclusions and/or perform an
inference correctly?
>7. Did you communicate your findings?
>8. Was the report brief (about 2 pages long)?
>9. Did it include an executive summary?
>10. Was the report done in Rmd (knitr)?
>
>The grading will be for each of the criteria
>  * 1 point - criteria met acceptably 
>  * 0 points - criteria not met
>
>Score will be the sum of the points.
